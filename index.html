        Saskatchewan, Canada, and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical

      <li>
        <strong>1989</strong> - At the age of 17, in June 1989, 
        Elon Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen's University, avoiding 
        mandatory service in the South African military. His plan was to go 
        United States where he thought great things are possible, more than 
        any other country. And it would be easy to get to the United States from Canada.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1992</strong> - He left Queen's University in 1992 to study business

      <li>
        <strong>1995</strong> - In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a 
        web software company which developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the

        service called PayPal and Musk became the CEO and company's largest shareholder by 
        owning 11.7% of shares. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was later 
        renamed PayPal. PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign 
        where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service. Musk 
        met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while both were students at Ontario's 
        Queen's University. They married in 2000. Their first son, Nevada Alexander Musk, died of 
        sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks. Musk was ousted in October 2000 
        from his role as CEO of PayPal (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with
         other company leadership, notably over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure 
         to Microsoft Windows.
